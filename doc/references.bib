%   abstract = {This paper presents a one-dimensional-in-space mathematical model of an amperometric biosensor. The model is based on the reaction-diffusion equations containing a non-linear term related to Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the enzymatic reactions. The stated problem is solved numerically by applying the finite difference method. Several types of finite difference schemes are used. The numerical results for the schemes and couple mathematical software packages are compared and verified against known analytical solutions. Calculation results are compared in terms of the precision and computation time.},

%   abstract = {The matched interface and boundary method (MIB) and ghost fluid method (GFM) are two well-known methods for solving elliptic interface problems. Moreover, they can be coupled with efficient time advancing methods, such as the alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods, for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with interfaces. However, to our best knowledge, all existing interface ADI methods for solving parabolic interface problems concern only constant coefficient PDEs, and no efficient and accurate ADI method has been developed for variable coefficient PDEs. In this work, we propose to incorporate the MIB and GFM in the framework of the ADI methods for generalized methods to solve two-dimensional parabolic interface problems with variable coefficients. Various numerical tests are conducted to investigate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed methods. Both the semi-implicit MIB-ADI and fully-implicit GFM-ADI methods can recover the accuracy reduction near interfaces while maintaining the ADI efficiency. In summary, the GFM-ADI is found to be more stable as a fully-implicit time integration method, while the MIB-ADI is found to be more accurate with higher spatial and temporal convergence rates.},

There, we restricted ourselves to the one- and two-dimensional models. Having both adapted our computing program to the three-dimensional case and significantly speeded it up, now we are able present the results in the three-dimensional model. Solving an inverse modeling problem, we obtain explicit formulas for the diffusion coefficient and reaction rate as functions of temperature. We calculate the activation energies and other parameters, thus obtaining conditions for occurrence of synthesis. In addition, using the results of the three-dimensional model, we find the optimal temperature for energy consumption in the YAG synthesis.},

Among the various numerical methods which exist to solve this equation, a finite-difference method called the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) variant has been used in the present research. While this method is known for its unconditional stability, problems may arise in practice. During the initial stages of the simulation, discontinuous temperature distributions may be calculated which cannot exist in reality. The cause of the deteriorated temperature distribution is explained and is illustrated in a real casting configuration. A new numerical technique is described which overcomes these problems. Practical simulation results illustrate the benefits of the method.},
